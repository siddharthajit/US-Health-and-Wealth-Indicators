The relationship between the factors of health and income is a widely debated and discussed topic today. The higher a personâ€™s income, higher is the chance of that person being less healthy and premature death. Improving the income of a person in a family is one of the ways that is proposed to improve their health. In order to substantiate this claim, proper research is needed that shows if there exists a definitive relation between money and health.
