# Exploring-Health-and-Wealth

The relationship between the factors of health and income is a widely discussed. In this notebook, we try to explore if there is a signifcant correleation between the health and wealth indicators of US Population. In order to do the analysis, a point estimate of income is developed at the county level after merging and summarizing from various data sources. Further, the health data indicators at the county level are acquired from public databases. Finally, these datasets are merged to form the final python dataframe.

The hypothesis is that people who earn lower income are at greater risk of poor health. The analysis conducts supports the initial claim regarding the hypothesis

This project aims to explore that relationship further through various analysis from different data sets based on county, states in the US, and a final report is presented with findings.
